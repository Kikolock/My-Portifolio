## My Portfolio

## Technologies used and why.

For this project, I need to create a Profession Portfolio using all skills learned so far in this course. For that, I used HTML and CSS to create the interface and first steps for what in future is supposed to be my interactive and complete portfolio.

## Challenges for future improvement

During this project I had been trough challenges as searching online for the right CSS codes to implement, also for future I hope to improve this portfolio adding more interaction using JavaScript and other technologies that I'm still learning.

## The Project

This challenge consists in creating a professional portfolio using only HTML and CSS. The main requirements for this projects are:

- Is presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
- When clicks one of the links in the navigation, the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
- When clicks on the link to the section about their work, the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
- The first application's image should be larger in size than the others
- Clicking on the images of the applications, takes to that deployed application
- When resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices, is presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
