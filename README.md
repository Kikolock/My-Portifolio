## My Portifolio

## Technologies used and why.

For this project, I need to create a Profession Portifolio using all skills learned so far in this course. For that I used HTML and CSS to create the interface and first steps for what in future is supposed to be my interactive and complete portifolio.

## Challenges for future improvement

During this project I had been trought challengs as seaching online for the right CSS codes to implement, also for futute I hope to improve this portifolio adding more interaction using Javascript and other technologies that I'm still learning.
